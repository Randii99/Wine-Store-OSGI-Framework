# Wine-Store-OSGI-Framework
For the 4th year 2nd semester project in the Modern Topic in IT (MTIT) module at SLIIT, we developed a simple CLI-based Wine Store publisher/consumer scenario using the OSGi framework.

In this project there are four publishers and four consmers ,
1. Wine store cashier publisher / consumer
2. Wine store manager publisher / consumer
3. Wine store supplier publisher / consumer
4. Wine store storekeeper publisher / consumer
